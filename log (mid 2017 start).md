# 100 Days Of Code - Log


## Day 1: June 20, 2017 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**  Machine Learning course on Coursera - Progress and aim to finalize week to by end of day

**Thoughts:**  Rebooting 100 days of code after being pulled into Devslopes Unity project and some accounting contracts.  Feels good to get going again!
