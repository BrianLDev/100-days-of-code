## Day 3: June 29, 2017 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  Making progress on the Machine learning course

**Thoughts:**  This is tough because it's new, but I'm getting the hang of it the more I work on it

## Day 2: June 26, 2017 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**  Machine Learning course on Coursera - Plowed my way through the Gradient Descent calculation in Matlab after rewatching some of the videos and digging deep into the linear algebra equation

**Thoughts:**  That was a beast, but I'm not going to let it beat me.  Determined to push through no matter how hard it is.

## Day 1: June 20, 2017 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**  Machine Learning course on Coursera - Progress and aim to finalize week to by end of day

**Thoughts:**  Rebooting 100 days of code after being pulled into Devslopes Unity project and some accounting contracts.  Feels good to get going again!
