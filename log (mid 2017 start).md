# 100 Days Of Code - Log


## Day 1: June 10, 2017 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  Excel VBA Ultimate Developer Course - progress on section 6

**Thoughts:**  Rebooting 100 days of code after being pulled into Devslopes Unity project and some accounting contracts.  Feels good to get going again!
