# 100 Days Of Code - Log


## Day 07: January 26, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  
Day 1 of Intro to Machine Learning Bootcamp.  Covered Python, Pandas, and Linear Regression confusion matrix in the AM.  Titanic (again) from 12pm to 2pm. Housing price prediction from 2pm to 4:30pm.

**Thoughts:**  
Unfortunately I've already learned most of this at the other meetup and weekend bootcamp.  This wasn't the best or most focused course I've taken yet, hopefully tomorrow will be better.

## SKIPPED: January 25, 2019 - Friday
Busy day at work at the new job and then after work event to welcome new hires until midnight.

## Day 06: January 24, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
Tableau A to Z - 2nd data set - business challenge

**Thoughts:**  
Short one today, was very busy with work

## Day 05: January 23, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
Started Tableau A to Z (Data Visualization) course on Udemy.  Installed Tableau, downloaded first data set and created first dat Viz.

**Thoughts:**  
I'm really enjoying this so far and Tableau / Data Viz in general will be hugely important at my new job and for personal projects in the future.

## Day 04: January 22, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**  
Created Titanic v5 which removes all items that require the internet (e.g. !wget) over to a Jupyter notebook that pulls the data from the Titanic folder.  The new version will also work with Google Colab so it's cross compatible.  Now an internet connection is no longer required and can be worked on at anytime including while I ride the train.  Also looked into potential visualizations for the linear regression covariable weights, and started coding one.  Will need to finalize in the future.

**Thoughts:**  
Today was my first day starting my role as Controller at Sentieo.  So with that being my primary focus, I only was able to spend about 30 minutes coding while I was on the train commuting to/from work, and a bit after I got home.

## Day 03: January 21, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**  
Updated the Titanic Jupyter notebook - created a section that displayed the weights given to each of the features in the linear regression formula, sorted by the largest impact.  By far, being a man is the #1 way to die if you are on a sinking ship.  

**Thoughts:**  
Quick one today, but an important one.  by seeing the actual weights associated with each feature, that gives me clues on how to improve the model in the future.  Next I would like to create a visual for those weights using either matplotlib or seaborn, and then take steps to improve my prediction above 75%

## Day 02: January 20, 2019 - Sunday
*NOTE - I'll be writing quick notes from here on out. The focus of 100 days of code is on the code, not the daily log, so most of my time and energy will be focused accordingly.*

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed day 2 of 2 of the Python for Data Science bootcamp. Submitted my first Kaggle competition (Titanic)! 75% accurate, would like to get 80% or above in the future. Improved on Venkatesh's original version by using the mean age for each Pclass to fill in any null values, instead of a fixed 28.  Also learned more about Pandas.

**Thoughts:**  
Excited to have completed my first Kaggle competition from start to finish.  Will be taking on more in the future and challenging myself to score higher and build my Kaggle ranking.

## Day 01: January 19, 2019 - Saturday
**Today's Progress:**  
Jumping back into 100 Days of Code and 100 Days of ML Code.  Going to spend the 100 days focused on HANDS-ON (avoid videos when possible) Machine Learning, Data Science, and Data Visualization.

Completed day 1 of 2 on the Python for Data Science bootcamp - hosted on the Google campus in Mountain View and taught by Venkatesh Tadinada.  9am through 4:30pm.  For the most part, this was almost the same as the previous Meetup I had with him where he did a walkthrough of the Titanic Kaggle competition and his in depth Jupyter/Colab notebook for each step.  In addition, he did some Python tutorials and some Pandas as well.  It was a good refresher, and I pushed myself to dig deeper into the steps, modifying things along the way like filling the NaN items in the 'Age' feature with the mean instead of a fixed number, and then attempting to sub-fill them by taking the mean for each class 1, 2, 3.  Ran into an pandas error on the complex nested formula that it was referencing a copy of the data and not updating the original.  Since day 2 of the bootcamp is for Pandas, I'm going to hold off until tomorrow and revisit.  

Venkatesh put a challenge to the group that if any of us could go to Hacker Rank, complete the following data type challenges: easy-all, medium-a few, hard-one.  If we do that, he'll give us 50% off a future ML/DS course which I am interested in.  The ML one next weekend is normally $300 so that would save $150.  Jumping on to HackerRank now and will chip away until it's time to sleep.

**Thoughts:**  
Feels great to be getting back into 100 days of coding and being surrounded by smart, motivated people all wanting to do the same.  Time has been and always been the biggest challenge to keeping the streak going, and I expect it will likely be my biggest challenge when I start my new job on Tuesday.  But as much as I'm able, I'm going to keep this going.
