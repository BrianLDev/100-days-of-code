# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 4)

## R4D22: August 15, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
  - More strong progress moving through the regex chapter (this is a long one)
  - All the in book examples added to regexChapterExamples.py

**Thoughts:**  
Still so much going on but glad to keep moving forward on this Regex chapter because I'm starting to see how powerful it can be when you understand it.
Saving all my notes and files for future reference

## R4D21: August 14, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
  - 07 RegEx - improvements to isPhoneNumber.py - added groups
  - Big progress moving through the regex chapter
  - Added all the in book examples to a new python script regexChapterExamples.py

**Thoughts:**  
So tired.  So busy.  But must keep going.

## R4D20: August 13, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **DataQuest**
  - Mission 314 - Dictionaries and Frequency tables

**Thoughts:**  
I jumped back to DataQuest because it seemed like a good one to do some quick coding while prepping my condo for sale and slammed with work.  Still seems too basic for what I've already learned.  But next up is functions so hopefully that will be more useful.

## R4D17: August 9, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **DataQuest**
  - Mission 312 - Lists and for loops

**Thoughts:**  
Continuing onward with DataQuest.  These intro courses are basic... may skip to the next section or just cruise through as fast as possible

- **DataQuest**
  - Mission 311 - Programming in Python

**Thoughts:**  
18+ hour day at work.  So damned tired...

## R4D15: August 7, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **DataQuest**
  - Mission 200 - variables and data types

**Thoughts:**  
Bought DataQuest 1 year subscription while it was 50% off, so thought I would give it a try and take a brief break from the Automate with Python Regex chapter

## R4D14: August 6, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
  - 07 RegEx - updated isPhoneNumber.py to use regex.

**Thoughts:**  
Still slammed.  Can't keep doing this forever.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [isPhoneNumber.py with regex](https://github.com/BrianLeip/Automate_With_Python/blob/913919aacac815cdba78a8b05b5cf4ccb34383db/07-RegEx/isPhoneNumber.py)
---

## R4D13: August 5, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
  - 07 RegEx - created isPhoneNumber.py - a quick script that checks if a chunk of text in a string is a phone number.  Meant as an early comparison to show how much easier it will be to use RegEx instead later in the chapter.

**Thoughts:**  
Slammed as usual with both work and getting the condo ready for sale.  But making sure to continue carving out time to code.

## R4D12: August 4, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
  - 06-Strings: Table printer (practice project) 
    - takes a 2D nested list of strings and prints them out in a nice format with all data right justified in each column which is adjusted to the right width and each sublist item paired with the other sublist items
  - Completed the Strings chapter
- **General**
  - Set up a complete coding environment on my PC in orange county
  - Installed the new windows terminal
  - Created a custom color theme for windows terminal
  - Added WakaTime extension to VS Code


**Thoughts:**  
Got VS Code, anaconda, python, etc all set up on my PC back in Orange County.  Wanted to switch up the coding environment to windows to make sure that I can code anywhere on any system.  Also installed the new windows terminal, set up a custom theme on it, and installed WakaTime so that I can track how much time I spend coding each day and on different projects.

Also, it feels **great** to be done with the Strings chapter!  With my busy schedule that one took longer than expected.  That was the last chapter in the python programming basics section so now it's on to the fun stuff - Automating Tasks.

## R4D10: August 2, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Created prank.py - a python script that replaces what's in the clipboard with a random fun phrase like `"This is the FBI.  Do not move.  We will arrive shortly"`.
- The script also has a nice section that checks if pyperclip has already been installed on their computer and if not, it automatically runs `pip install pyperclip`
- Now I just need to figure out how to link this to the Ctrl+C keyboard shortcut, put it on someone's computer, and then watch with childish glee

**Thoughts:**  
This was a fun one, and love that I'm already able to start making my own little programs using the Automate with Python book

## R4D9: August 1, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
  - 06-Strings: Created bullet point adder python script

**Thoughts:**  
Very tired today, but still got in some coding.  This was a pretty interesting one actually because it took hidden text in the clipboard (when you Ctrl+C copy from a website), then manipulates it and replaces the clipboard with an updated version.  I can imagine that people have played some fun pranks by messing with someones clipboard :)

## R4D8: July 31, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
  - Created 06_pw.py password locker (Note - need to install pyperclip module for it to work.  `pip install pyperclip`)

**Thoughts:**  
After an long stretch of being insanely busy, the major work deadlines are done and family reunion is over.  Time to get back in the coding groove.

## R4D7: July 28, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
  - Improved the picnicTable.py printout so that it auto-determines the left and right with based on the length of the data in the dictionary.  Looks nicer and makes it easier to call the function

**Thoughts:**  
Spending as much time with friends and family as I can this weekend during the family reunion.  40 adults and 20 kids showed up and I haven't seen or talked to most of them in 20 years or so.  Still carving out time when I can to code.

---

## R4D6: July 26, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
  - Created picnicTable.py - uses .ljust() and .rjust() to format text output.

**Thoughts:**  
Still got a little coding in today even though I'm extremely busy at work and also flying out to Montana for a family reunion today. Back from reunion on Monday and the last major deadline at work is on Tuesday, so free time will be sparse until Wed next week but will code as often as I can.
