# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 02: January 20, 2019 - Sunday
*NOTE - I'll be writing quick notes from here on out. The focus of 100 days of code is on the code, not the daily log, so most of my time and energy will be focused accordingly.*

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed day 2 of 2 of the Python for Data Science bootcamp. Submitted my first Kaggle competition (Titanic)! 75% accurate, would like to get 80% or above in the future. Improved on Venkatesh's original version by using the mean age for each Pclass to fill in any null values, instead of a fixed 28.  Also learned more about Pandas.

**Thoughts:**  Excited to have completed my first Kaggle competition from start to finish.  Will be taking on more in the future and challenging myself to score higher and build my Kaggle ranking.

## Day 01: January 19, 2019 - Saturday
**Today's Progress:**  Jumping back into 100 Days of Code and 100 Days of ML Code.  Going to spend the 100 days focused on HANDS-ON (avoid videos when possible) Machine Learning, Data Science, and Data Visualization.

Completed day 1 of 2 on the Python for Data Science bootcamp - hosted on the Google campus in Mountain View and taught by Venkatesh Tadinada.  9am through 4:30pm.  For the most part, this was almost the same as the previous Meetup I had with him where he did a walkthrough of the Titanic Kaggle competition and his in depth Jupyter/Colab notebook for each step.  In addition, he did some Python tutorials and some Pandas as well.  It was a good refresher, and I pushed myself to dig deeper into the steps, modifying things along the way like filling the NaN items in the 'Age' feature with the mean instead of a fixed number, and then attempting to sub-fill them by taking the mean for each class 1, 2, 3.  Ran into an pandas error on the complex nested formula that it was referencing a copy of the data and not updating the original.  Since day 2 of the bootcamp is for Pandas, I'm going to hold off until tomorrow and revisit.  

Venkatesh put a challenge to the group that if any of us could go to Hacker Rank, complete the following data type challenges: easy-all, medium-a few, hard-one.  If we do that, he'll give us 50% off a future ML/DS course which I am interested in.  The ML one next weekend is normally $300 so that would save $150.  Jumping on to HackerRank now and will chip away until it's time to sleep.

**Thoughts:**  Feels great to be getting back into 100 days of coding and being surrounded by smart, motivated people all wanting to do the same.  Time has been and always been the biggest challenge to keeping the streak going, and I expect it will likely be my biggest challenge when I start my new job on Tuesday.  But as much as I'm able, I'm going to keep this going.
