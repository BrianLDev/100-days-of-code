# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: February 18, 2017 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  Completed 3 sections of BNR Swift3 book

**Thoughts:**  I want to solidify my understanding of Swift while also moving forward in the Devslopes iOS10 course

## Day 2: February 19, 2017 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  Completed another section of BNR Swift3 book

**Thoughts:**  Got a better understaning of tuples, control transfer statements (continue, break, etc), repeat-while loops, etc.  Completed good ol' FIZZ BUZZ using both if/else statements and a switch using a tuple

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [BNR-Swift sections 2-6 (loops)](https://github.com/BrianLeip/BNR-Swift3/commit/079f1ec08a5be479389db84fa465689fb4b0ddb8)
