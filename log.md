## R4D3: July 22, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**  
*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*
- 05 Dictionaries - Practice questions
- made 05_fantasyGameInventory.py using Dictionaries
- created a funtion that can add loot (items in a list) to the fantasy game inventory (Dictionary)

**Thoughts:**  
Another long day but I kicked ass at work and made sure to get some coding in too.  Keepin that streak going.
