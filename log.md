# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 5)

## R5-D03: March 20, 2020 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
- More progress on the Stanford Algorithms and Data Structures course 1
  - Merge sort
  - Recursive calling
  - Calculating big O notation of merge sort vs insertion sort or bubble sort
- Added US State Coronavirus case tracking to my Coronavirus EDA Jupyter notebook

**Thoughts:**  
Most of the Stanford course has been video related so far.  It's good but I'm ready to get hands-on ASAP.  

Also, as Coronavirus spreads like wildfire and CA went on lockdown today, I spent some more time analyzing the John Hopkins University Covid-19 Data.  It's a bit messy (States are mixed with counties and cities), but after some data wrangling I was able to isolate the states and graph it on a chart.  New York is growing at a scary rate, and California is starting to wake up to the seriousness of this.

## R5-D02: March 19, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Played around with a 2D map asset in Unity that I'd like to use to model Coronavirus outbreak.

**Thoughts:**  
A little detour from the Algorithms course, but was fun to play around in Unity again and get a feel for what I could create with the Map asset.

## R5-D01: March 18, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Started the Stanford  Algorithms and Data Structures course on Coursera

**Thoughts:**  
Even though I've been coding over time, it feels good getting back into the 100 Days of Code flow and committing to doing it every day.  The daily habit is vital, even if it's only a little bit every day, and the 100 Days of Code community on Twitter is great.  Let's do this!
