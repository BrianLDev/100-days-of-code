## R4D10: August 2, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Created prank.py - a python script that replaces what's in the clipboard with a random fun phrase like `"This is the FBI.  Do not move.  We will arrive shortly"`.
- The script also has a nice section that checks if pyperclip has already been installed on their computer and if not, it automatically runs `pip install pyperclip`
- Now I just need to figure out how to link this to the Ctrl+C keyboard shortcut, put it on someone's computer, and then watch with childish glee

**Thoughts:**  
This was a fun one, and love that I'm already able to start making my own little programs using the Automate with Python book

## R4D9: August 1, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
  - 06-Strings: Created bullet point adder python script

**Thoughts:**  
Very tired today, but still got in some coding.  This was a pretty interesting one actually because it took hidden text in the clipboard (when you Ctrl+C copy from a website), then manipulates it and replaces the clipboard with an updated version.  I can imagine that people have played some fun pranks by messing with someones clipboard :)

## R4D8: July 31, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
  - Created 06_pw.py password locker (Note - need to install pyperclip module for it to work.  `pip install pyperclip`)

**Thoughts:**  
After an long stretch of being insanely busy, the major work deadlines are done and family reunion is over.  Time to get back in the coding groove.

## R4D7: July 28, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
  - Improved the picnicTable.py printout so that it auto-determines the left and right with based on the length of the data in the dictionary.  Looks nicer and makes it easier to call the function

**Thoughts:**  
Spending as much time with friends and family as I can this weekend during the family reunion.  40 adults and 20 kids showed up and I haven't seen or talked to most of them in 20 years or so.  Still carving out time when I can to code.

## R4D6: July 26, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
  - Created picnicTable.py - uses .ljust() and .rjust() to format text output.

**Thoughts:**  
Still got a little coding in today even though I'm extremely busy at work and also flying out to Montana for a family reunion today. Back from reunion on Monday and the last major deadline at work is on Tuesday, so free time will be sparse until Wed next week but will code as often as I can.
