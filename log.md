# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 31: March 29, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
Started in on Python for Financial Analysis and Algo Trading course:
03-DataFrames

**Thoughts:**  
Been a busy week at work, working late (until 2am on Thu) but want to keep moving on this too.

## Day 30: March 27, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed another section and examples of Python for Financial Analysis and Algo Trading course:
02-NumPy

**Thoughts:**  
Cruising along and taking notes in Evernote as I go for future reference in Python, Numpy, and Pandas

## Day 29: March 25, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed the first chapter and exercises for the Python for Financial Analysis and Algo Trading course.  01-Python Crash Course.  

**Thoughts:**  
After talking about all the different coding options with the guys at Py and Beer, I decided that my best and most relevant option at the moment is Python for Financial Analysis and Algo trading (Udemy course).  It's something that I actually started a while back and have been watching videos while I shower on my ipad, but this is a very hands on course and need to get my hands dirty in the code.  So far I'm actually really liking the course and going to keep rolling forward on it.

## Day 28: March 24, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
Went to Py and Beer meetup with Connor and crew.  Talked about a few Python projects, met some people and created some repos for Python challenges and Python Cookbook.

**Thoughts:**  
More of a networking / social day than a pure coding one but important to have those every now and then and connect with other people that are getitng into coding Python.

## Day 27: March 23, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed the last available challenges from Python Project night at Yelp - Beginner SIG.  String Manipulation, args and kwargs.

**Thoughts:**  
These were great challenges, and I learned quite a bit, even from fixing the small bugs that happened when Simeon rushed to create this for everyone.  String manipulation funcitons are important and ubiquitous so that was a great one. Using args and kwargs in functions to allow dynamic inputs is challenging for most people at first, so I made sure I did it multiple times to better understand it.

---

## Day 26: March 22, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
Continued with Python Project night at Yelp - Beginner SIG.  Completed basic logic: looping & iteration

**Thoughts:**  
Completed this using the most efficient string methods I was aware of.  But realized after that Simeon's intention was to do it using while and for loops to improve understanding of loops, so I redid the functions using while and for loops.  Was more challenging to get the syntax to work right but gave me a better understanding.

---

## Day 25: March 21, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
Continued with Python Project night at Yelp - Beginner SIG.  Completed basic logic: operators_and_if and indexing challenges (actually finished later that night on 3/20)

**Thoughts:**  
Loving these challenges.  Going to keep working through them all until I finish what Simeon has created so far (he's creating them on the fly and it's a WIP)

## Day 24: March 20, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
Python Project night at Yelp - Beginner SIG.  Set up repo, completed the 2 Gtting Started challenges - getting_started.py and basic_functions.py.

**Thoughts:**  
Jumping back in to 100 days of code after a break to focus on a major project at work.
Python Project night at Yelp - Went to the Beginner Special Interest Group (SIG) led by Simeon Franklin.  This was actually really good and a fresh, hands-on approach to learning code.  All interactive challenges are actual python programs that you run in terminal, and you create the functions that will make all the tests pass.  Paired up with a guy that was a little less familiat with github, git, and python than I am so it was also helpful to teach someone how to work through some of the challenges.  Like Richard Feinman says, "When 1 person teaches another, 2 people learn."

## Day 23: February 24, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed Kaggle's Data Cleaning Challenge day 5 of 5 - Inconsistent Data Entry

**Thoughts:**  
Another interesting and useful one.  Using fuzzywuzzy library to find similar text matches with fuzzy logic matching, and then replace incorrect spelling is going to be super useful in the future.  Save this one.

## Day 22: February 23, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed Kaggle's Data Cleaning Challenge day 4 of 5 - Character Encodings

**Thoughts:**  
This one was a little dull but important to know if data isn't loading properly and how to find and fix the encoding issue.

## Day 20: February 17, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
Started and completed Kaggle's Data Cleaning Challenge day 2 of 5 - Scale and Normalize data

**Thoughts:**  
Missed a few days but won't let that deter me.
The scale and normalize data challenge was an excellent one and combined data cleaning, statistics, and data viz.  Save for future reference

## Day 19: February 12, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed Kaggle's Data Cleaning Challenge day 1 of 5 - Handling Missing Values.

**Thoughts:**  
Want to focus on improving my Data Cleaning and Pandas experience, this is a good and quick 5 day challege to facilitate that.

## Day 18: February 11, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**  
Made a lot of progress on my Kaggle Petfinder notebook. Laid out structure of the notebook with all 7 steps of the Machine Learning Process, completed 3 of them, and working on step 4 - Feature Engineering and Data Cleansing.

**Thoughts:**  
Got back on the wagon today and cranked out a couple hours worth of work.  Feels good and want to keep the streak going again.

---

## Day 14: February 3, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
Tried getting the Kaggle API set up with Google Colab but there were a lot of issues with the kaggle.json credentials file and Googling that issue shows that almost everyone has problems with it.  Changed to instead use Dropbox and github, but remove the image DataSets since those are the largest by far.  Got it working and now can successfully use both Github and Colab by downloading the files from my Dropbox folder.

**Thoughts:**  
It was a frustrating day getting this set up and wish I could have spent that time coding.  But now that the setup part is done, future days can be spent analyzing the datasets and doing ML.

---

## Day 13: February 2, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  
Set up Colab notebook for the Kaggle petfinder competition that I'm planning to tag team with a coder I met on Twitter. Tried to push the DataSet to github but it's too big.

**Thoughts:**  
The DataSet was too big to sync to github, so I also looked into other ways to make this work - possibly use the Kaggle API?

## Day 12: February 1, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed Tableau AtoZ section 03 - Time Series, Aggregation using Unemployment statistics.

**Thoughts:**  
This was an important one for me since I work with a lot of stock data which is considered time series data.  Will continue to play around and experiment with it to continue improving.

---

## Day 11: January 31, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
Continued Tableau AtoZ course - Downloaded all course DataSources and instructor vizzes, created folder structure, then started on section 3.

**Thoughts:**  
Relatively short day but making progress every day

---

## Day 10: January 30, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
Back to the Tableau A to Z course since it will be crucial to my new job.  Completed 02-Business Challenge - Sales by rep by region data viz. *

**Thoughts:**  
I haven't heard back from my Kaggle petfinder partner in a bit, and since Data Viz (Tableau especially) is going to be crucial in my new job, I'm focusing my attention on that.  Really love the program and the Udemy course too, going to keep moving on this and finish as fast as possible and then jump back to Kaggle and Machine Learning.

## Day 09: January 29, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**  
Busy day but I connected with a fellow coder doing 100 Days of code on Twitter who is taking on the Kaggle Pet Finder pet adoption challenge.  Joined the challenge, downloaded the data and started digging in.

**Thoughts:**  
I have a lot going on with my new job, but want to keep pushing forward on 100 Days of Code as much as possible. Also it's fun to collaborate with someone else on a Kaggle competition and even though it involves some things that are more complex (natural language processing, sentiment analysis, image recognition, etc.), sometimes the best way to learn is to get in a little over your head and force yourself to figure it out.

## Day 08: January 27, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
Day 2 of Intro to Machine Learning Bootcamp.  
- Delved into ML statistics, linear regressions, recapped confusion matrix.
- Completed the ML Outline (Titanic reshuffle) where all the key Titanic linear code lines are shuffled in the wrong order.  Re-order them in the correction sections of the 7 step Machine Learning process
- K Means clustering
- MINST handwritten number image recognition

**Thoughts:**  
Good day, much better than day 1.  But a lot of the topics we covered are quite deep and will require some deep dives in the future to truly grok everything.

---

## Day 07: January 26, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  
Day 1 of Intro to Machine Learning Bootcamp.  Covered Python, Pandas, and Linear Regression confusion matrix in the AM.  Titanic (again) from 12pm to 2pm. Housing price prediction from 2pm to 4:30pm.

**Thoughts:**  
Unfortunately I've already learned most of this at the other meetup and weekend bootcamp.  This wasn't the best or most focused course I've taken yet, hopefully tomorrow will be better.

## SKIPPED: January 25, 2019 - Friday
Busy day at work at the new job and then after work event to welcome new hires until midnight.

---

## Day 06: January 24, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
Tableau A to Z - 2nd data set - business challenge

**Thoughts:**  
Short one today, was very busy with work

---

## Day 05: January 23, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
Started Tableau A to Z (Data Visualization) course on Udemy.  Installed Tableau, downloaded first data set and created first dat Viz.

**Thoughts:**  
I'm really enjoying this so far and Tableau / Data Viz in general will be hugely important at my new job and for personal projects in the future.

## Day 04: January 22, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**  
Created Titanic v5 which removes all items that require the internet (e.g. !wget) over to a Jupyter notebook that pulls the data from the Titanic folder.  The new version will also work with Google Colab so it's cross compatible.  Now an internet connection is no longer required and can be worked on at anytime including while I ride the train.  Also looked into potential visualizations for the linear regression covariable weights, and started coding one.  Will need to finalize in the future.

**Thoughts:**  
Today was my first day starting my role as Controller at Sentieo.  So with that being my primary focus, I only was able to spend about 30 minutes coding while I was on the train commuting to/from work, and a bit after I got home.

---

## Day 03: January 21, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**  
Updated the Titanic Jupyter notebook - created a section that displayed the weights given to each of the features in the linear regression formula, sorted by the largest impact.  By far, being a man is the #1 way to die if you are on a sinking ship.  

**Thoughts:**  
Quick one today, but an important one.  by seeing the actual weights associated with each feature, that gives me clues on how to improve the model in the future.  Next I would like to create a visual for those weights using either matplotlib or seaborn, and then take steps to improve my prediction above 75%

---

## Day 02: January 20, 2019 - Sunday
*NOTE - I'll be writing quick notes from here on out. The focus of 100 days of code is on the code, not the daily log, so most of my time and energy will be focused accordingly.*

**Today's Progress:**  
Completed day 2 of 2 of the Python for Data Science bootcamp. Submitted my first Kaggle competition (Titanic)! 75% accurate, would like to get 80% or above in the future. Improved on Venkatesh's original version by using the mean age for each Pclass to fill in any null values, instead of a fixed 28.  Also learned more about Pandas.

**Thoughts:**  
Excited to have completed my first Kaggle competition from start to finish.  Will be taking on more in the future and challenging myself to score higher and build my Kaggle ranking.

---

## Day 01: January 19, 2019 - Saturday
**Today's Progress:**  
Jumping back into 100 Days of Code and 100 Days of ML Code.  Going to spend the 100 days focused on HANDS-ON (avoid videos when possible) Machine Learning, Data Science, and Data Visualization.

Completed day 1 of 2 on the Python for Data Science bootcamp - hosted on the Google campus in Mountain View and taught by Venkatesh Tadinada.  9am through 4:30pm.  For the most part, this was almost the same as the previous Meetup I had with him where he did a walkthrough of the Titanic Kaggle competition and his in depth Jupyter/Colab notebook for each step.  In addition, he did some Python tutorials and some Pandas as well.  It was a good refresher, and I pushed myself to dig deeper into the steps, modifying things along the way like filling the NaN items in the 'Age' feature with the mean instead of a fixed number, and then attempting to sub-fill them by taking the mean for each class 1, 2, 3.  Ran into an pandas error on the complex nested formula that it was referencing a copy of the data and not updating the original.  Since day 2 of the bootcamp is for Pandas, I'm going to hold off until tomorrow and revisit.  

Venkatesh put a challenge to the group that if any of us could go to Hacker Rank, complete the following data type challenges: easy-all, medium-a few, hard-one.  If we do that, he'll give us 50% off a future ML/DS course which I am interested in.  The ML one next weekend is normally $300 so that would save $150.  Jumping on to HackerRank now and will chip away until it's time to sleep.

**Thoughts:**  
Feels great to be getting back into 100 days of coding and being surrounded by smart, motivated people all wanting to do the same.  Time has been and always been the biggest challenge to keeping the streak going, and I expect it will likely be my biggest challenge when I start my new job on Tuesday.  But as much as I'm able, I'm going to keep this going.
