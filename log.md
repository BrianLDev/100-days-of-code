# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 5)

## R5-D08: March 25, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Stanford Algorithms
  - Week 1 challenge questions
- Coronavirus
  - Merged the John Hopkins (Global) and Covid Tracking Project (US States) datasets together into one jupyter notebook
  - Updated stats for 3/25
  - I'm predicting that the US will surpass both Italy and China to have the most confirmed Coronavirus cases by Friday 3/27
- Unity
  - Completed a few minigame tutorials and started on the Unity ML-Agent tutorial

**Thoughts:**  
Got a decent amount of coding done today, feels good.  But the looming threat of Coronavirus is threatening all that we hold dear.  Keep moving forward, that's all we can do.

## R5-D07: March 24, 2020 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Stanford Algorithms
  - Finished week 1: Divide & conquer
  - Asymptotic Analysis
  - Big Oh Notation with mathematical proofs
  - Big Omega and Theta Notation with mathematical proofs

**Thoughts:**  
Did this on Tue but forgot to log it until Wed AM.  
Week 1 is done.  Course is till highly theoretical, not hands-on.  Hopefully that will change soon.

## R5-D06: March 23, 2020 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Coronavirus Analysis
  - JH changed their live data format so adjusted for this
  - JH also deprecated their historic tracking data (non-global)
  - Created a new jupyter notebook using data from Covid Tracking Project and got the state data and charts caught up to where they were with the JH file

**Thoughts:**  
Spent a good chunk 2-3 hours on this today and got a lot done.  It's frustrating to see that JH is no longer tracking useful historic data but it is what it is.  Found a good alternative with the Covid tracking project.  

As I was going through the new data, I realized that Covid tracking only has US state data, and JH now only has global data.  So rather than using separate files I'll likely merge them together in the future.

## R5-D05: March 22, 2020 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Coronavirus EDA - Refreshed with updated data

**Thoughts:**  
Another difficult personal day with family issues.  Still got in a bit of coding.

## R5-D04: March 21, 2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Coronavirus EDA - Added a new US state confirmed cases chart excluding New York to zoom in on the other states

**Thoughts:**  
Tough day today, dealing with some serious family issues.  Despite not wanting to, I still made time for a bit of coding.

## R5-D03: March 20, 2020 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
- More progress on the Stanford Algorithms and Data Structures course 1
  - Merge sort
  - Recursive calling
  - Calculating big O notation of merge sort vs insertion sort or bubble sort
- Added US State Coronavirus case tracking to my Coronavirus EDA Jupyter notebook

**Thoughts:**  
Most of the Stanford course has been video related so far.  It's good but I'm ready to get hands-on ASAP.  

Also, as Coronavirus spreads like wildfire and CA went on lockdown today, I spent some more time analyzing the John Hopkins University Covid-19 Data.  It's a bit messy (States are mixed with counties and cities), but after some data wrangling I was able to isolate the states and graph it on a chart.  New York is growing at a scary rate, and California is starting to wake up to the seriousness of this.

## R5-D02: March 19, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Played around with a 2D map asset in Unity that I'd like to use to model Coronavirus outbreak.

**Thoughts:**  
A little detour from the Algorithms course, but was fun to play around in Unity again and get a feel for what I could create with the Map asset.

## R5-D01: March 18, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Started the Stanford  Algorithms and Data Structures course on Coursera

**Thoughts:**  
Even though I've been coding over time, it feels good getting back into the 100 Days of Code flow and committing to doing it every day.  The daily habit is vital, even if it's only a little bit every day, and the 100 Days of Code community on Twitter is great.  Let's do this!
