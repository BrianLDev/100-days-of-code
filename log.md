# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 5)

## R5-D02: March 19, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Played around with a 2D map asset in Unity that I'd like to use to model Coronavirus outbreak.

**Thoughts:**  
A little detour from the Algorithms course, but was fun to play around in Unity again and get a feel for what I could create with the Map asset.

## R5-D01: March 18, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Started the Stanford  Algorithms and Data Structures course on Coursera

**Thoughts:**  
Even though I've been coding over time, it feels good getting back into the 100 Days of Code flow and committing to doing it every day.  The daily habit is vital, even if it's only a little bit every day, and the 100 Days of Code community on Twitter is great.  Let's do this!
