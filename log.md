## R5-D18: April 8, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Major overhaul to notebooks and workflow
  - Created a separate ETL notebook to gather the data, wrangle and reformat it, then export to .csv
  - Revised the Analytics notebook so that it now pulls the data created by the ETL notebook
  - Added a few charts and metrics, including tracking US Counties where my friends and family live

**Thoughts:**  
Back in action.  Spent most of my day (9-10 hours or so) revamping the Covid-19 analytics notebook to create a separate ETL data wrangling file that exports .csv files to be used by the analytics notebook.  

Feels good to be back in it, and love seeing the result of exported csv files that I created with Python and Pandas, and then using them for a streamlined analytics notebook.

**Today's Progress:**  
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Took a bit of a mental health break after the frustrating experience with the DS and Algorithms exam, and finding out that I was not accepted into the UIUC Masters program.

Being cooped up for too long on Coronavirus quarantine is wearing on me.

## R5-D15: April 2, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Data Structures and Algorithms
  - Last day of studying for the Upcoming UIUC Data Structures and Algorithms exam
  - Took exam
- LeetCode
  - Day 2 of 30 challenge: HappyNumber
- CoronaVirus Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Up early and studying Data Structures and Algorithms all day. Took the exam and nailed it on the first 3/4 of it...then somehow bombed the last 1/4.  Got very close to the threshhold so I'm still hopeful that I will get accepted to the Masters program, since the exam is optional anyways.  Would be very painful if I don't... keeping my fingers crossed.

Also completed today's LeetCode challenge and updated CoronaVirus analytics.

**Today's Progress:**  
- Stanford Algorithms
  - Finished week 1: Divide & conquer
  - Asymptotic Analysis
  - Big Oh Notation with mathematical proofs
  - Big Omega and Theta Notation with mathematical proofs

**Thoughts:**  
Did this on Tue but forgot to log it until Wed AM.

## R5-D06: March 23, 2020 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Coronavirus Analysis
  - JH changed their live data format so adjusted for this
  - JH also deprecated their historic tracking data (non-global)
  - Created a new jupyter notebook using data from Covid Tracking Project and got the state data and charts caught up to where they were with the JH file

**Thoughts:**  
Spent a good chunk 2-3 hours on this today and got a lot done.  It's frustrating to see that JH is no longer tracking useful historic data but it is what it is.  Found a good alternative with the Covid tracking project.  

As I was going through the new data, I realized that Covid tracking only has US state data, and JH now only has global data.  So rather than using separate files I'll likely merge them together in the future.

## R5-D05: March 22, 2020 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Coronavirus EDA - Refreshed with updated data

**Thoughts:**  
Another difficult personal day with family issues.  Still got in a bit of coding.

---

## R5-D04: March 21, 2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Coronavirus EDA - Added a new US state confirmed cases chart excluding New York to zoom in on the other states

**Thoughts:**  
Tough day today, dealing with some serious family issues.  Despite not wanting to, I still made time for a bit of coding.

---

## R5-D03: March 20, 2020 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
- More progress on the Stanford Algorithms and Data Structures course 1
  - Merge sort
  - Recursive calling
  - Calculating big O notation of merge sort vs insertion sort or bubble sort
- Added US State Coronavirus case tracking to my Coronavirus EDA Jupyter notebook

**Thoughts:**  
Most of the Stanford course has been video related so far.  It's good but I'm ready to get hands-on ASAP.  

Also, as Coronavirus spreads like wildfire and CA went on lockdown today, I spent some more time analyzing the John Hopkins University Covid-19 Data.  It's a bit messy (States are mixed with counties and cities), but after some data wrangling I was able to isolate the states and graph it on a chart.  New York is growing at a scary rate, and California is starting to wake up to the seriousness of this.

## R5-D02: March 19, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Played around with a 2D map asset in Unity that I'd like to use to model Coronavirus outbreak.

**Thoughts:**  
A little detour from the Algorithms course, but was fun to play around in Unity again and get a feel for what I could create with the Map asset.

## R5-D01: March 18, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Started the Stanford  Algorithms and Data Structures course on Coursera

**Thoughts:**  
Even though I've been coding over time, it feels good getting back into the 100 Days of Code flow and committing to doing it every day.  The daily habit is vital, even if it's only a little bit every day, and the 100 Days of Code community on Twitter is great.  Let's do this!
