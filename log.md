-- Day 100! --

It's been a journey getting here with a lot of ups and downs; and I have to say, it feels good to cross the finish line.  I wanted to end with a bang so I finalized various projects over a few days and combined them into the day 100 finale.

Here's a little video recap that I put together to recap some of the things I completed over the 100 days of code challenge:

## R5-D97: July 18, 2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Tilted Game Jam 23
  - 12 hour game jam - made a story using mad libs and made a mini-game out of it in Unity
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
The game jam was fun and intense as always.  I ran out of time before finishing the full thing, but learned a lot along the way.  Games always take a LOT longer than people think to make, so for future game jams I'm going to keep it extremely simple.

## R5-D90: July 2, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Refactored all the variable names on the ETL notebook so that they are consistent and match the exported file names
  - Started gathering and formatting data from the Covid Tracking Project datasets
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Recently I decided it would be best to group my coding projects by days of the week to make the most of my time and achieve more focus.  

Since my top 2 (near term) priorities are 1. Finishing NovaForge and launching it for sale, and 2. Web Development, I'll spend most of my time on those.  But since I also love Data Science (despite the industry only hiring people with graduate degrees and that being 1-3 years away), I'll still spend 1 day a week on that too.

M - W = Web Dev  
Thu = Data Science / Python  
Fri - Sun = Game Dev  

So today's focus was on Data Science related projects, and I tackled a long niggling annoyance of refactoring all the variable names on the Covid-19 Analytics notebook so that they are consistent and match with the exported file names.  I also started gathering and organizing data from the Covid Tracking project, which has been marked as *PENDING* for a while, so it feels good to make progress on that front.

## R5-D89: July 1, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- NovaForge
  - 7+ hour day working on NovaForge
  - Completely remade camera controller for better movement, panning in space
  - Updated to Unity v2020.0.1b14, tweaked close space warp gravity so it still works on sim speed 5, disabled reverse gravity on supernova
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Tied in with yesterday's update, to truly fix NovaForge's camera panning on both mouse and gamepad and make it work in full 3D space with no "up" direction, I had to remake the camera controller script from scratch.  Took a while, but it was a good learning experience, diving into 3 dimensional rotations with euler angles, quaternions, local vs world rotations, etc.  The end result was a much cleaner and streamlined, but more effective camera controller script so all in all I'd say it was a success.  

Improved the supernova explosion and gravity reverse effect.  

I also spent a good chunk of time revising all the gravity settings (gravity, rotation speed, rotation attraction) along with the size of the gravity fields to give it the best "game feel".

## R5-D79: June 15, 2020 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**  
- NovaForge
  - Used photo editor tool to darken the space background scene yet retain the white stars
  - Supernovas temporarily reverse gravity after explosion
  - Big changes to UI system and input. Separated the UI Manager from GameManager and got gamepad controls working with options
  - added volume sliders to options
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Big 11+ hour day. As it usually happens with these big days, I started working on something simple, and that snowballed into bigger and bigger improvements.  

Really glad to have the Input system done and working, including the options menu selection (which was a lot harder to implement than expected).  There's still a bug with the mouse not being able to select options, but Google tells me this is a Unity bug.  I'll submit a bug fix request and keep an eye out for a fix.

## R5-D78: June 14, 2020 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Created a filter on the JH US States hot spot / cooling down to filter out non-states (cruise ships, Guam, Virgin Islands, etc)
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Very interesting to watch daily trends on the hot spots / cooling down for both countries and US states.  Based on the trends I'm seeing, it's unlikely that there will be a 2nd wave for any Countries / States that were already hit the worst (Italy, New York, etc).  Unless a new strand of the virus emerges...in which case all bets are off.

That being said, for any Countries / States that were either a bit too cautious with their lockdowns, or have not yet experienced a significant wave, those areas will be hit the hardest in the near future.  In the US, rural states are starting to get hit hard, along with California which went on early lockdown and has not experienced a significant wave yet.

I am most concerned about countries with large populations but relatively poor incomes and medical facilities.  Africa and India look to be the next areas that will be hit the hardest.

## R5-D77: June 13, 2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Calculated the daily % change for all historic stats (cases, deaths, recoveries) by country, us state, and us county
  - Calculated the exponential weighted moving avg (EWMA) of the daily % change for all historic stats (cases, deaths, recoveries) by country, us state, and us county
  - Isolated "hot spots" and "cooling down" spots by Country, US States
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
As rumors spread in both directions for Covid-19 (it's dying out / a second wave is coming) I wanted to dig in and see what's really going on.  In order to isolate which countries, states, and counties are seeing a new wave of cases, I needed to calculate the daily % change, and then smooth it with a weighted average.  The EWMA is better than a simple MA since it weighs recent data heavier.  

From there, I was able to isolate the hot / cold spots and some interesting info popped up:
- Countries near the equator seem to be getting hit especially hard right now (Brazil, Chile, Central Africa, etc) which is interesting because Covid-19 supposedly is destroyed quickly in sunlight.  Is this a different strain?
- States in the US that were previously hit the hardest, are now showing the lowest daily % increase (NY, NJ, MA).
- Conversely, states that were not hit as hard as other states are showing the highest daily % increases (AR, AZ, SC, AK, AL, NC)
- CA went on lockdown early and avoided the worst of it (excluding LA), but now with everything re-opening, CA is rising rapidly.  It's #13 in fastest daily growth rate.

## R5-D76: June 12, 2020 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Unity Events Test
  - 8+ hours learning C# events and how to use them within a game in Unity
  - Created a new project to test out and learn C# events and Unity events
  - Made one demo that tests events in code only (and Debug.Log)
  - Made another demo that uses events with interactive objects (player, enemy, sphere, global effect, gamemanager)
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
C# Events were something that I've been seeing pop up often, like in the Unity Input system, so I wanted to do a deep dive and understand them a lot better. Feel very comfortable with them now, and have a nice little working demo that I put together.  May use it for a YouTube tutorial.

## R5-D66: May 31, 2020 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
- FCC: Responsive Web Design: Applied Visual Design
  - Completed 5 more exercises
- Smarter way to learn HTML & CSS
  - Completed ch 6
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
I had set Web development aside for a while to work on the Sim Game Jam (NovaForge) but now that crunch time is over for that, I want to get back rolling on web dev.  Will probably split up my time 50%-75% web dev, 25%-50% game dev.  

A lighter day today since I spent most of it purging and selling things around the house.

## R5-D65: May 30, 2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  
- NovaForge
  - Ripping out all UI from the UI Builder and recreating with normal Unity UI
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
This is painful to do since UI Builder is supposed to be the future, but it just doesn't work properly yet and it's causing roadblocks in my project.  For example, I can't use Unity's new Input system because the UI Builder is tied to the old input system, directly in the library files that I can't edit.  But on the positive side, it was a good learning process and once the UI Builder officially launches, I'll be ahead of the curve.

Was pleasantly surprised to find that I almost rebuilt the full UI in one night, when doing the same thing in UI Builder took a few days.

## R5-D64: May 29, 2020 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
- NovaForge
  - Added average FPS tracking and changed auto-adjustment on low FPS to use this instead
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Chaos and unrest in the US.  George Floyd's death after a cop brutally kneeled on his neck while he was handcuffed and incapacitated has ignited a smoldering fire.  My twitter feed, which is normally 90% about this 100 days of code journey and other leaders in coding / tech, is now 90% filled with anger, rage against injustice, videos of riots, videos of police brutality, videos of buildings burning.  As if Covid-19 wasn't bad enough, now we have this on top of it.  I am losing faith in the future of this country.  It may be time to move on.  

Spent most of the day selling my belongings and purging what I don't need.  Still made time for coding but will likely be spending less time on that in the near future, until this is resolved.

## R5-D63: May 28, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
- NovaForge
  - Updated to Unity v2020.1.0b10.3837 (beta)
  - Tested it out, making sure no bugs and working properly
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
After around 40 coding hours over the last 3 days, I needed to shift focus to get some personal and contractor work done.  Still got a bit of coding in.  
Usually I avoid beta versions of Unity because they're notoriously unstable, but someone from the OC Indie Devs group recommended 2020.1 beta since it improves particle collisions and is specifically focused on stability improvements.  Turns out he was right, after the update it seems to run more stable and with more particles than on 2019.3.  Good to see.

## R5-D62: May 27, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- NovaForge
  - Set up a functioning options menu
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Relatively quick one today since I spent most of the day getting my external GPU set up, connected to my Macbook Pro, and rearranging my room, cords, cables, etc.  It's incredible though, having an eGPU connected to a MBP or Windows laptop gives you the portability of a laptop, combined with the power of a desktop, but with a smaller footprint and lower cost.  Can run both Mac and Windows.  Seriously mind blowing!  This is the setup I've been searching for.

Today I set up a functioning options menu in NovaForge using the old Unity UI (not UI Builder).  I haven't worked with the old UI system much before now but I was shocked with how easy it was to use compared to the UI Builder (in expermental phase).  Lesson learned, going to stick with the standard Unity UI until UI Builder is ready for prime time in a few months (or years).

Also uploaded a new version of the game to itch.io, and gave a quick demo presentation at the online OC Indie devs meetup today.

## R5-D61: May 26, 2020 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- NovaForge
  - 10+ hours on this today
  - Refactored the Element system into a namespace, reorganizing and cleaned up code, improvements to Elements.cs
  - Linked the Element colors to the particle system
  - Can do color gradients on particles now
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Another good day on NovaForge. Today was mainly coding focused, and I feel good about how the Element system is turning out.  Clean code using namespaces, structs, and premade public static accessors.

## R5-D60: May 25, 2020 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**  
- NovaForge
  - Another big day today 12.5 hours
  - Finally got the particle system custom colors working!  Looks so much better now
  - Added stats tracking, FPS tracking
  - Auto-adjusts sim speed when FPS to low
  - Lots of bug fixes, improvements and refactoring
  - Big progress on the Element System, close to being done with it
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Another big day today, and got a lot done, but this time on a decent amount of sleep.  This game is really coming together, and I feel close to getting v1.0 done and playable.  Maybe 1-2 more days at this pace.  

I had considered doing the "weekdays = regular coding, weekends = game dev" thing, but I don't want to stop when I'm this close to the finish line.  Just got to keep pushing through, then when I have something that's shippable for a rough v1.0, then I'll send it out to friends and family, and shift over to regular coding.

## R5-D59: May 24, 2020 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
- NovaForge
  - Live stream of my sim game jam on Twitch today
  - Too many Novaforge improvements to list today.  13+ hours of changes.
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Only caught 3-4 hours of sleep last night since I was working on Novaforge late into the night and then again early in the morning.  The live stream was fun, and they all seemed to like the game.  But since it's not complete yet I can't expect to win the competition. The goal here was to learn and to create something new, not to win anything.  So in that way it's mission accomplished.

Ended up working on Novaforge for 13+ hours today.  So many changes, improvements, and bug fixes to list.  Some big, some little, but overall this is starting to come together and get closer to my original vision.  It's intoxicating to see your creations start to take shape.

That being said, I also want to keep learning web dev, and my old buddies from the Data Science group want to work on some projects so I'll have to shuffle things around a bit.  Another 100 days of code guy on twitter is doing regular code during the week (web dev, data science, etc), and game dev on the weekend.  I like that idea, so I'm going to try that out starting this week.

OK, time to catch up on some sleep...

## R5-D58: May 23, 2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  
- NovaForge
  - Fix Unity errorrs that cropped up overnight
  - Tweaks to space warp gravity, and rotation speed to optimal values
  - Added and customized supernova FX
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
They're doing a live stream of the Sim Game Jam entries and my game (NovaForge) goes on tomorrow.  Technically it's already after the cutoff, but to give them something half decent to show on the stream, I'm adding some final touches to the game.

## R5-D57: May 22, 2020 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
- NovaForge
  - Fixed Restart funtionality: in game clouds disappear and camera resets
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Another one that Unity made Unnecessarily complex.  They somehow don't have a way to set the position (Transform) of a gameobject or Camera.  So if you want to simply move something to a specific location, a simple line like `camera.transform.position = newPosition;` or `camera.transform.Set(newPosition);` doesn't work.  

After Googling it and seeing all the other comments, this is a problem that so many people run into, and setting positions is such a fundamental part of a game that you would think this would be fixed by now.  But even with all it's flaws, Unity is 100x better than when you had to basically do everything on your own 15 years ago.

So even though this cost me another few hours, I figured it out in the end and next time will be that much easier.

## R5-D56: May 21, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
- NovaForge
  - Worked on setting the in-game element cloud colors. Unity makes this extraordinarily complicated to do.  Was at it for a few hours and nothing I tried worked.
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
It's amazing that something as simple as setting a start color for the particles is incredibly complicated in Unity. Here's what happened:  
- Changed ParticleSystem.color and got `ParticleSystem.color is deprecated, use ParticleSystem.main.color`
- OK, then I changed `ParticleSystem.main.color`, but that didn't do anything either.  It turns out that color is not a standard Color variable, but a `MinMaxGradient` variable where any number of sub-variables could be the active color
- There are also other modules like `ColorOverLifetimeModule` in the particle system that may override the color
- After finally finding the correct variable to change, I changed it, confirmed that it was changed in Debug.Log, and yet still the particle system remains white.  
- Called it a night

That was a very not-fun 2-3 hours spent trying to simply set the color of a particle system. It really makes a big difference visually in the game so I'd love to get it worked out, but Unity is not making it easy on me.  Hopefully they'll will streamline this in future versions.

**Today's Progress:**  
- DOTween Test (Unity)
  - Created a new project to test out the DOTween tool - used to animate UI
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
The game jam taught me that UI is an area I need to improve on, and also that Unity's UI Builder and UI Elements are still in very rough, early stages, so I need to use something more stable.  

To that end, I'm testing out DOTween which is a "Tweener" tool used by a ton of Unity developers along with Unity's canned UI system to create nice looking animated UI.

## R5-D52: May 17, 2020 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Simulation Game Jam (NovaForge)
  - Separated out the intro scene from game scene, added transition between the two
  - More improvements to menu system
  - Added mechanic to deploy space warps
  - Bundled game, added an icon and uploaded to itch.io
  - Done (for now)
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Sim game jam submission day: spent all day on NovaForge 13+ hours or so and then submitted it to itch.io for the competition.  
Was it perfect?  No.  Were there a lot of things missing?  Yup.  But after multiple game jams where I joined but didn't submit because it wasn't "good enough", I'm forcing myself to submit this one anyways, flaws and all.  I have a tendency to beat myself up when I don't create something that lives up to the vision and expectations that were in my head, but I now know that all creative people experience that feeling.  

What's important here is that I met my objectives of 1) Finishing a freaking game jam, 2) learning things along the way (I learned a ton actually), and 3) have a nugget of a good game that could be turned into something great in the future.  I achieved all 3 of those things, and I'm learning to use setbacks and imperfect creations as fuel to get better, not as a whip to flog myself with.

UI has admittedly never been my strong suit, but I need to focus to get something into NovaForge ASAP.  Only 2 days left so it's time to just get a functioning UI prototype working and move on to other stuff.  Fortunately, the things I'm learning will make UI much easier in the future, and help me in every single project/game that I work on, since everything needs UI.  So despite being time consuming it's vital.  

Also, Feels good to knock out another section of FCC.  Moving forward.

## R5-D48: May 13, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Simulation Game Jam (NovaForge)
  - None today
- Free Code Camp
  - did a few exercises but forgot to commit them to git
- A Smarter Way to Learn HTML and CSS
  - Started book alongside FCC since it's highly regarded as a good hands-on book to retain info
  - Completed ch 1, 2, 3
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
I'm enjoying this and feeling like I'm progressing , but a part of me wonders if I'm spreading myself too thin.  Currently doing a game jame in Unity/C# and learning new game dev techniques, learning HTML and CSS with both Free Code Camp and Smarter Way to Learn book, and also will be continuing the MongoDB course.  

On second thought, it's all a matter of time.  If I only do 1-2 hours of coding a day, then this is definitely too much.  But if I do 6-10 hours of coding a day, then this is very much manageable.  So I just need to dedicate more time and allocate appropriately.  I'd say 70% game jam given the looming deadline of the 17th, 10% FCC, 10% Smarter way to learn book, 10% MongoDB.  A little progress every day.

  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
The C# Jobs system definitely has potential to improve the efficiency of the particles but the package is still in preview and unstable.  Time is short before the game jam ends on Sunday so need to shift focus back to other priorities.

## R5-D46: May 11, 2020 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Simulation Game Jam (NovaForge)
  - More testing of Unity DOTS system
- Unity Utility Scripts
  - Created custom camera controller script
  - Started a new repo to track all custom scripts in a library
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Was up very late/early with client work so I didn't have as much time to dedicate to this as I wanted.  But time is running short on the game jam (ends Sunday 5/17) so I need (and want) to carve out more time for this.  The majority of my client work is done for the month so that frees me up a lot more.

## R5-D45: May 10, 2020 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Simulation Game Jam (NovaForge)
  - Learned about the Unity DOTS / Job system, started testing it out
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
After testing NovaForge out on my macbook pro and getting terrible performance, making it more efficient is key.  And the DOTS / C# Job System is the best way to make that happen.  
In the Job system test / tutorial project I'm working on, using Jobs and Burst compiler improved FPS from 6 to 350! That's a 58x improvement.  There's a bit of a learning curve here, and it's still in preview mode and volatile, but once I get it down it will unlock huge potential.

**Today's Progress:**  
- Simulation Game Jam (NovaForge)
  - Worked on getting Particle collisions working

**Thoughts:**  
Had to do a lot of client work today so not as much time for coding today, but still squeezed some in. 

Spent about an hour working on getting particle collisions working so that the Space Warps can consume the particles and grow.  But still wasn't working so I'll have to dig back in tomorrow and figure it out.

  - Set up git repo, fixed many .gitignore issues, created Unity project
  - Created prototype space scene with particle clouds and movement
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Simulation Game jam started!  

*Theme = "A matter of degree"*   
I brainstormed on different ideas and game mechanics and landed on one that should be pretty fun to make.  Elements (matter) are created stars explode in the raging temperatures (degree) of a supernova.  

*Nova Forge - A supernova simulator where new elements are created*  

Spent the day getting the git repo set up (lots of issues with .gitignore that I eventually worked out), then creating a prototype space scene with particle clouds that you can fly around in.

  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
*Catch-up for last week of coding Apr 26 - May 1*  
I joined a game jam that starts on May 1st, so I'm doing a little research on Unity tools / libraries to prepare.  The DOTS / ECS system is a rebuild of the entire Unity library that drastically improves performance.  The game jam is a simulation (processor heavy) so I'm looking into this as a potential option for the game jam.

## R5-D34: April 25, 2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Unity: Eye Catching UI Tutorial
  - Spent an hour or so getting the overly large files compressed, ignored from git, but still usable in the Unity project
  - Loaded the project and tested out the different UI scenarios.  All working according to plan
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
It took an hour or so to fix but I resolved the tutorial's large file issue. Frustrating for a UI tutorial, but I'm considering it practice to get better with git ignoring specific files, compressing files, etc.
Now I can actually start the tutorial!  If they have a recommendation section, let them know the files are too damn big.

  - Some of their files are too big for git (>60MB). Hitting a roadblock will need to revisit tomorrow
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
Very frustrating that a tutorial about something as lightweight as UI would use massively large assets that are too big for git.  I'll need to play around to see how to compress or exclude those files so that I can move forward on this.

**Today's Progress:**  
- UnityMLAgentPenguins
  - Finished this project!!
  - Added all scripts, prefabs, etc
  - Updated scripts to be compatible with MLAgents 0.15.1
  - Trained Penguin Agents Neural Net using TensorFlow to find fish and feed her baby
  - Added the trained NN model to the Penguin prefab
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
This was definitely one of the more challenging but rewarding projects I've worked on.  Challenging because the MLAgents library is evolving rapidly and none of the code from the tutorial works out of the box.  There are also multiple versions of the tutorial, all of which are out of date.  Took a lot of tweaking and refactoring to get it to work, but when it all came together in the end it was very rewarding.

Now that I've gotten my first Unity ML agents project under my belt, this opens up a whole new world to me and I'm excited to dive in.

  - Restarted project to incorporate all recent changes to MLAgent package
    - MLAgents 0.15.1 and Baracuda 0.6.1 packages
  - Added ML Agent Example projects
    - modified them to get them working (missing scripts on the prefabs)
    - tested example projects out, gain better understanding of MLAgent library
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
*Note - Been coding every day but not logging it on here.  Getting everything caught up from Apr 14 to Apr 23.*  

These 3 days sort of blurred together (late nights / early mornings) so I'm combining them together here.

Made great progress on the Unity Machine Learning Agent Penguins tutorial.  This one is especially hard because the MLAgent package is changing rapidly and the tutorial is already out of date. Need to do a lot of tweaks and adjustments to get things to work.  Frustrating, but great for learning experience.

**Thoughts:**  
*Note - Been coding every day but not logging it on here.  Getting everything caught up from Apr 14 to Apr 23.*  

Spent the full day coding on this game jam.  To be honest, it turned out pretty crappy, but I konw that you have to allow yourself to create bad shit if you every want to create quality, so I'm not brushing it off.  The next one will be better, and the one after that even better, and so on.  Persistence is key.

## R5-D23: April 13, 2020 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**  
- LeetCode
  - Finished Last Stone Weight
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Updated stats for the day as usual

**Thoughts:**  
The LeetCode Last Stone Weight challenge was a tougher one than previous ones.  But it was good practice to create helper functions like "insertSorted" for a C++ vector and "printVector".  Those functions should really already be built in to the vector library already so it's surprising that they're not.  

It might be a good idea for me to start creating a library of my own with helper functions that I create, which will save a lot of time and follow the DRY method (Don't Repeat Yourself).

## R5-D18: April 8, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Covid-19 (Coronavirus) Analytics
  - Major overhaul to notebooks and workflow
  - Created a separate ETL notebook to gather the data, wrangle and reformat it, then export to .csv
  - Revised the Analytics notebook so that it now pulls the data created by the ETL notebook
  - Added a few charts and metrics, including tracking US Counties where my friends and family live

**Thoughts:**  
Back in action.  Spent most of my day (9-10 hours or so) revamping the Covid-19 analytics notebook to create a separate ETL data wrangling file that exports .csv files to be used by the analytics notebook.  

Feels good to be back in it, and love seeing the result of exported csv files that I created with Python and Pandas, and then using them for a streamlined analytics notebook.

  - Last day of studying for the Upcoming UIUC Data Structures and Algorithms exam
  - Took exam
- LeetCode
  - Day 2 of 30 challenge: HappyNumber
- CoronaVirus Analytics

**Thoughts:**  
Up early and studying Data Structures and Algorithms all day. Took the exam and nailed it on the first 3/4 of it...then somehow bombed the last 1/4.  Got very close to the threshhold so I'm still hopeful that I will get accepted to the Masters program, since the exam is optional anyways.  Would be very painful if I don't... keeping my fingers crossed.

Also completed today's LeetCode challenge and updated CoronaVirus analytics.

## R5-D06: March 23, 2020 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Coronavirus Analysis
  - JH changed their live data format so adjusted for this
  - JH also deprecated their historic tracking data (non-global)
  - Created a new jupyter notebook using data from Covid Tracking Project and got the state data and charts caught up to where they were with the JH file

**Thoughts:**  
Spent a good chunk 2-3 hours on this today and got a lot done.  It's frustrating to see that JH is no longer tracking useful historic data but it is what it is.  Found a good alternative with the Covid tracking project.  

As I was going through the new data, I realized that Covid tracking only has US state data, and JH now only has global data.  So rather than using separate files I'll likely merge them together in the future.

## R5-D04: March 21, 2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Coronavirus EDA - Added a new US state confirmed cases chart excluding New York to zoom in on the other states

**Thoughts:**  
Tough day today, dealing with some serious family issues.  Despite not wanting to, I still made time for a bit of coding.

## R5-D03: March 20, 2020 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  
- More progress on the Stanford Algorithms and Data Structures course 1
  - Merge sort
  - Recursive calling
  - Calculating big O notation of merge sort vs insertion sort or bubble sort
- Added US State Coronavirus case tracking to my Coronavirus EDA Jupyter notebook

**Thoughts:**  
Most of the Stanford course has been video related so far.  It's good but I'm ready to get hands-on ASAP.  

Also, as Coronavirus spreads like wildfire and CA went on lockdown today, I spent some more time analyzing the John Hopkins University Covid-19 Data.  It's a bit messy (States are mixed with counties and cities), but after some data wrangling I was able to isolate the states and graph it on a chart.  New York is growing at a scary rate, and California is starting to wake up to the seriousness of this.

## R5-D02: March 19, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Played around with a 2D map asset in Unity that I'd like to use to model Coronavirus outbreak.

**Thoughts:**  
A little detour from the Algorithms course, but was fun to play around in Unity again and get a feel for what I could create with the Map asset.

## R5-D01: March 18, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**  
- Started the Stanford Algorithms and Data Structures course on Coursera

**Thoughts:**  
Even though I've been coding over time, it feels good getting back into the 100 Days of Code flow and committing to doing it every day.  The daily habit is vital, even if it's only a little bit every day, and the 100 Days of Code community on Twitter is great.  Let's do this!
