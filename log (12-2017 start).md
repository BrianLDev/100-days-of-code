# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: December 28, 2017 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  Read Data Science Intensive "Getting Started" section on springboard.com.  Set up git repository for DS Intensive course.  Update git and log to restart 100 days of code.

**Thoughts:**  I'm very excited to start up 100 days of code again!  My main focus over the next 100 days will be the Data Science Intensive course which starts on 1/2/2018, but I'm also very interested in learning more about Bitcoin (Mastering Bitcoin book) and Ethereum blockchain development using Solidity.  It will be difficult doing all this while also maintaining a full time job, handling accounting for multiple side clients, and also regular home/friend/family/gf duties, but I'm up for the challenge and I'm starting now.
