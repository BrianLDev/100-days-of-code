# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 4: January 1, 2018 - Monday
**Today's Progress:**  1.5 hours - Continued configuring bitcoin core bitcoin.conf file for bitcoind daemon.  Ch 3 of Mastering Bitcoin book

**Thoughts:**  A lot of issues cropped up in what should have been pretty straightforward.  The current version of bitcoind has an error where you can't customize the Bitcoin Blockchain drive location; it throws an error and crashes.  I had to troubleshoot that, delete the previously downloaded Blockchain from bitcoin-qt that took a few days to download, then start fresh.  
bitcoind -printtoconsole -reindex

## Day 3: December 30, 2017 - Saturday
**Today's Progress:**  1.5 hours - Joined up with Devslopes Coffee & Code live coding session - Intro to Solidity Development on the Ethereum Blockchain

**Thoughts:**  This was a good overview and led me to realize that I'll need to have a stronger understanding of Javascript, Html and CSS before Blockchain programming in Solidity.  I have a couple great books for that ("A Smarter Way to Learn..." series) and the Devslopes Web slope as well.  Will I actually have the time to learn all this while taking the Data Science Intensive course, working full time, doing PT accounting work, etc?  Need to give it some thought and focus on only 1-3 big things at a time so I don't get stretched too thin.

## Day 2: December 29, 2017 - Friday
**Today's Progress:**  Configure, compile and install Bitcoin core Node on Linux Ubuntu:
1) Fixed the Ubuntu VM Ethernet issue (took 2 hours! Note - it was related to a NAS firmware update and change in the virtual networking switch)
2) Installed VS Code on Ubuntu VM
3) Completed the Chapter 3 section: Compiling Bitcoin Core from the Source Code.  Configured and installed Bitcoin Core by combining info from Mastering Bitcoin book, and searching the web for missing info to fill in the gaps (e.g. installing the correct Berkeley DB)

**Thoughts:**  Altogether I spent a solid 4.5 hours working on this today.  According to the Author of Mastering Bitcoin, this is the most technical and complicated chapter of the book and tells some people to skip it.  But I'm up for the challenge and it's something I'd like to learn so I'm gettin it done.

## Day 1: December 28, 2017 - Thursday
**Today's Progress:**  Read Data Science Intensive "Getting Started" section on springboard.com.  Set up git repository for DS Intensive course.  Update git and log to restart 100 days of code.

**Thoughts:**  I'm excited to start up 100 days of code again!  My main focus over the next 100 days will be the Springboard Data Science Intensive course which starts on 1/2/2018, but I'm also very interested in learning more about Bitcoin (Mastering Bitcoin book) and Ethereum blockchain development using Solidity.  It will be difficult doing all this while also maintaining a full time job, handling accounting for multiple side clients, and also regular home/friend/family/gf duties, but I'm up for the challenge and I'm starting today.
