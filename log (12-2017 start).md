# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 29: January 26, 2018 - Friday
**Today's Progress:**  1.5 hours - ch 4 of 5 on DataCamp - Data Types for Data Science.  Covered datetime objects, converting to string/datetimes, comparing now vs UTC time, and working with timezones.

**Thoughts:**  Making progress but still so much to do and not enough time.  I want to block off a good chunk of Sat & Sun to hammer this stuff out.

## Day 28: January 25, 2018 - Thursday
**Today's Progress:**  1.5 hours - ch 3 of 5 on DataCamp - Data Types for Data Science.  Covered the collections module with Counter, DefaultDict, OrderedDict, etc.

**Thoughts:**  The examples in this section of DataCamp aren't very good but to make it into a positive I need to do more troubleshooting to get the code to work which always leads to learning.

## Day 24 thru 27: January 21 thru 24, 2018 - Sunday thru Wednesday
**Today's Progress:**  Finished ch 2 of 5 on DataCamp - Data Types for Data Science.  Did a little each day, the most on Wednesday.  Covered in depth usage of Dictionaries and accessing data, and reading dictionaries from csv files.

**Thoughts:**  This was a rough chapter with poor instructions and overly complex exercises.  I even went through one of them with my mentor (PHD, full time Data Scientist using Python) and he was as frustrated with it as I was.  That being said, it started to dabble in CSV imports and exports which I'm interested in so pushing through.

## Day 23: January 20, 2018 - Saturday
**Today's Progress:**  1 hour - Progress on chapter 2 of 5 of the DataCamp - Data Types for Data Science.  Working with lists, tuples and dictionaries.  Also tried out DataCamps Daily Practice exercises.  

**Thoughts:**  I really like the DataCamp Daily Practice exercises, they're a great way to solidify and reinforce what's been learned before.  I'll probably start doing half daily practice and half new material because if I just rush forward without practicing what was learned then nothing will stick.

## Day 16: January 13, 2018 - Saturday
**Today's Progress:**  3.75 hours - Completed all 5 chapters of the Intermediate Python for Data Science course on DataCamp

**Thoughts:**  I spent a lot more time than normal on this but I wanted to push to get some solid progress on the course.  There's still so much left to do in the course and this is just the tip of the iceberg.  I'm loving python so far, especially the data viz with matplotlib.  I can use a lot of these skills for work in accounting/finance, tracking my own portfolios, running simulations, etc.  Excited to learn more!

## Day 15: January 12, 2018 - Friday
**Today's Progress:**  1 hr - Intermediate Python for Data Science (DataCamp) - Pandas and DataFrames, improved Jupyter and Github workflows

**Thoughts:**  Today felt like I finally got a good workflow/routine down for DataCamp, combined with live Python coding in Jupyter, combined with 100DaysOfCode tracking on Github.  Do an example on DataCamp, then create a Python Jupyter Notebook for each example and copy/paste/save it.  That will allow me to come back and reference examples in the future if I need to and also keep Github tracking moving.  I also figured out how to run Jupyter from terminal without having to use the shitty Anaconda Dashboard.  Open terminal, go to the folder that you want to work in, then type Jupyter Notebook and it will start Jupyter in a browser using the current folder you're in.  That's a time saver because the Anaconda Dashboard would never remember previous directories and I'd waste time navigating back every time I open or save a file.  Making progress every day, looking forward to more tomorrow.

## Day 14: January 11, 2018 - Thursday
**Today's Progress:**  1 hr - Intermediate Python for Data Science (DataCamp)

**Thoughts:**  Busiest day yet but making 1 hour of code happen anyways.  The worst is behind me, will have more time over the weekend

## Day 13: January 10, 2018 - Wednesday
**Today's Progress:**  1 hr - Quick one today.  Installed Anaconda Python package on my macbook pro, tested out a few python scripts using Jupyter and matplotlib

**Thoughts:**  Doing the DataCamp exercises is a great way to learn but since everything is in their safe, sanitized environment, it feels disconnected from coding in a "real" Python environment.  To fix that, I installed the Anaconda Python install that includes a bunch of Data Science related packages like Numpy and Matplotlib.  Tested it out, got it working, and ready to roll.

## Day 12: January 9, 2018 - Tuesday
**Today's Progress:**  1.5 hrs - Intermediate Python for Data Science (DataCamp), weekly call with Mentor

**Thoughts:**  Still super busy but made time for my 30 min call with my Data Science mentor and 1 hour on the intermediate python course on DataCamp.  This section is on graphically plotting data with matplotlib and I'm loving it.

## Day 10 & 11: January 8, 2018 - Sunday & Monday
**Today's Progress:**  Spend the last 2 days making progress on the Python boot camp.  Finished the Intro to Python section, more to go

**Thoughts:**  This is going to be a crazy week with multiple deadlines at work and with clients, and taking care of my puppy that's been sick and still not house trained.  Still going to push myself to get at least 1 hr of Python coding in each day.  Who needs sleep, right?

## Day 9: January 6, 2018 - Saturday
**Today's Progress:**  1 hr - Intro to Python for Data Science (DataCamp)

**Thoughts:**  Spent most of the day doing a major cleaning and reorg of my home, but made sure to get 1 hour of coding in.  Python boot camp on DataCamp.  I'm a hands on learner so this is right up my alley: watching a video then doing 5-10 examples with actual code.  Good stuff going to do more tomorrow.

## Day 8: January 5, 2018 - Friday
**Today's Progress:**  2 hrs - Research and write up the 3 Capstone project ideas for Data Science Intensive course.  

**Thoughts:**  I love all 3 ideas and would like to be able to do them all at some point in my life when time permits.  The one that probably has the most immediate use to me and could also turn into a service / startup idea for is idea #1 - CryptoCurrency price analysis.  I put out the idea to my mentor, the Springboard community, and will also post on Twitter to get some feedback.

## Day 7: January 4, 2018 - Thursday
**Today's Progress:**  1 hr - Read the Capstone project guidelines for Data Science Intensive course.  Brainstormed on some ideas for the project.  

**Thoughts:**  Since the Capstone project is where I'll spend the majority of my time in this course, I want to pick a project that combines my current passions and interests.  Currenly that revolves around Bitcoin/Blockchain/CryptoCurrencies, and also AI and Machine Learning.  I'll publish my ideas tomorrow once they're more fleshed out.

## Day 6: January 3, 2018 - Wednesday
**Today's Progress:**  2 hours - Completed section 2.1 of Data Science Intensive course.  Also spent some time getting familiar with 2 Blockchain Cryptocurrency wallets: Daedalus for Cardano/ADA, and IOTA wallet.

**Thoughts:**  Most of my day was tied up with both my main job and finishing up a contractor project, but I pushed to make sure I got 1 hour of code in too.

## Day 5: January 2, 2018 - Tuesday
**Today's Progress:**  1 hour - Introductory call with my Springboard Mentor - Nate Kugland, Data Scientist at AirBnB.  Also reviewed the full course material and manually added everythig in to Asana so I can schedule and track my progress along the way.

**Thoughts:**  Nate seems like a good guy and look forward to working with him and leaning on him when I have any questions.  After reviewing the course schedule I can see that it's going to be a lot of work and I'll have to make some sacrifices to keep moving forward.  Going to get started in on it tomorrow.

## Day 4: January 1, 2018 - Monday
**Today's Progress:**  1.5 hours - Continued configuring bitcoin core bitcoin.conf file for bitcoind daemon.  Ch 3 of Mastering Bitcoin book

**Thoughts:**  A lot of issues cropped up in what should have been pretty straightforward.  The current version of bitcoind has an error where you can't customize the Bitcoin Blockchain drive location; it throws an error and crashes.  I had to troubleshoot that, delete the previously downloaded Blockchain from bitcoin-qt that took a few days to download, then start fresh.

## Day 3: December 30, 2017 - Saturday
**Today's Progress:**  1.5 hours - Joined up with Devslopes Coffee & Code live coding session - Intro to Solidity Development on the Ethereum Blockchain

**Thoughts:**  This was a good overview and led me to realize that I'll need to have a stronger understanding of Javascript, Html and CSS before Blockchain programming in Solidity.  I have a couple great books for that ("A Smarter Way to Learn..." series) and the Devslopes Web slope as well.  Will I actually have the time to learn all this while taking the Data Science Intensive course, working full time, doing PT accounting work, etc?  Need to give it some thought and focus on only 1-3 big things at a time so I don't get stretched too thin.

## Day 2: December 29, 2017 - Friday
**Today's Progress:**  Configure, compile and install Bitcoin core Node on Linux Ubuntu:
1) Fixed the Ubuntu VM Ethernet issue (took 2 hours! Note - it was related to a NAS firmware update and change in the virtual networking switch)
2) Installed VS Code on Ubuntu VM
3) Completed the Chapter 3 section: Compiling Bitcoin Core from the Source Code.  Configured and installed Bitcoin Core by combining info from Mastering Bitcoin book, and searching the web for missing info to fill in the gaps (e.g. installing the correct Berkeley DB)

**Thoughts:**  Altogether I spent a solid 4.5 hours working on this today.  According to the Author of Mastering Bitcoin, this is the most technical and complicated chapter of the book and tells some people to skip it.  But I'm up for the challenge and it's something I'd like to learn so I'm gettin it done.

## Day 1: December 28, 2017 - Thursday
**Today's Progress:**  Read Data Science Intensive "Getting Started" section on springboard.com.  Set up git repository for DS Intensive course.  Update git and log to restart 100 days of code.

**Thoughts:**  I'm excited to start up 100 days of code again!  My main focus over the next 100 days will be the Springboard Data Science Intensive course which starts on 1/2/2018, but I'm also very interested in learning more about Bitcoin (Mastering Bitcoin book) and Ethereum blockchain development using Solidity.  It will be difficult doing all this while also maintaining a full time job, handling accounting for multiple side clients, and also regular home/friend/family/gf duties, but I'm up for the challenge and I'm starting today.
