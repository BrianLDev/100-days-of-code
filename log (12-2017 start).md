# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 7: January 4, 2018 - Thursday
**Today's Progress:**  1 hr - Read the Capstone project guidelines for Data Science Intensive course.  Brainstormed on some ideas for the project.  

**Thoughts:**  Since the Capstone project is where I'll spend the majority of my time in this course, I want to pick a project that combines my current passions and interests.  Currenly that revolves around Bitcoin/Blockchain, AI and Machine Learning.  I'll publish my ideas tomorrow once they're more fleshed out.

## Day 6: January 3, 2018 - Wednesday
**Today's Progress:**  2 hours - Completed section 2.1 of Data Science Intensive course.  Also spent some time getting familiar with 2 Blockchain Cryptocurrency wallets: Daedalus for Cardano/ADA, and IOTA wallet.

**Thoughts:**  Most of my day was tied up with both my main job and finishing up a contractor project, but I pushed to make sure I got 1 hour of code in too.

## Day 5: January 2, 2018 - Tuesday
**Today's Progress:**  1 hour - Introductory call with my Springboard Mentor - Nate Kugland, Data Scientist at AirBnB.  Also reviewed the full course material and manually added everythig in to Asana so I can schedule and track my progress along the way.

**Thoughts:**  Nate seems like a good guy and look forward to working with him and leaning on him when I have any questions.  After reviewing the course schedule I can see that it's going to be a lot of work and I'll have to make some sacrifices to keep moving forward.  Going to get started in on it tomorrow.

## Day 4: January 1, 2018 - Monday
**Today's Progress:**  1.5 hours - Continued configuring bitcoin core bitcoin.conf file for bitcoind daemon.  Ch 3 of Mastering Bitcoin book

**Thoughts:**  A lot of issues cropped up in what should have been pretty straightforward.  The current version of bitcoind has an error where you can't customize the Bitcoin Blockchain drive location; it throws an error and crashes.  I had to troubleshoot that, delete the previously downloaded Blockchain from bitcoin-qt that took a few days to download, then start fresh.

## Day 3: December 30, 2017 - Saturday
**Today's Progress:**  1.5 hours - Joined up with Devslopes Coffee & Code live coding session - Intro to Solidity Development on the Ethereum Blockchain

**Thoughts:**  This was a good overview and led me to realize that I'll need to have a stronger understanding of Javascript, Html and CSS before Blockchain programming in Solidity.  I have a couple great books for that ("A Smarter Way to Learn..." series) and the Devslopes Web slope as well.  Will I actually have the time to learn all this while taking the Data Science Intensive course, working full time, doing PT accounting work, etc?  Need to give it some thought and focus on only 1-3 big things at a time so I don't get stretched too thin.

## Day 2: December 29, 2017 - Friday
**Today's Progress:**  Configure, compile and install Bitcoin core Node on Linux Ubuntu:
1) Fixed the Ubuntu VM Ethernet issue (took 2 hours! Note - it was related to a NAS firmware update and change in the virtual networking switch)
2) Installed VS Code on Ubuntu VM
3) Completed the Chapter 3 section: Compiling Bitcoin Core from the Source Code.  Configured and installed Bitcoin Core by combining info from Mastering Bitcoin book, and searching the web for missing info to fill in the gaps (e.g. installing the correct Berkeley DB)

**Thoughts:**  Altogether I spent a solid 4.5 hours working on this today.  According to the Author of Mastering Bitcoin, this is the most technical and complicated chapter of the book and tells some people to skip it.  But I'm up for the challenge and it's something I'd like to learn so I'm gettin it done.

## Day 1: December 28, 2017 - Thursday
**Today's Progress:**  Read Data Science Intensive "Getting Started" section on springboard.com.  Set up git repository for DS Intensive course.  Update git and log to restart 100 days of code.

**Thoughts:**  I'm excited to start up 100 days of code again!  My main focus over the next 100 days will be the Springboard Data Science Intensive course which starts on 1/2/2018, but I'm also very interested in learning more about Bitcoin (Mastering Bitcoin book) and Ethereum blockchain development using Solidity.  It will be difficult doing all this while also maintaining a full time job, handling accounting for multiple side clients, and also regular home/friend/family/gf duties, but I'm up for the challenge and I'm starting today.
