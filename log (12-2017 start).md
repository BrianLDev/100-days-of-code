# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 2: December 29, 2017 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**  Configure, compile and install Bitcoin core Node on Linux Ubuntu:
1) Fixed the Ubuntu VM Ethernet issue (took 2 hours! Note - it was related to a NAS firmware update and change in the virtual networking switch)
2) Installed VS Code on Ubuntu VM
3) Completed the Chapter 3 section: Compiling Bitcoin Core from the Source Code.  Configured and installed Bitcoin Core by combining info from Mastering Bitcoin book, and searching the web for missing info to fill in the gaps (e.g. installing the correct Berkeley DB)

**Thoughts:**  Altogether I spent a solid 4.5 hours working on this today.  According to the Author of Mastering Bitcoin, this is the most technical and complicated chapter of the book and tells some people to skip it.  But I'm up for the challenge and it's something I'm determined to learn so I'm pushing through.  The worst part is done.

## Day 1: December 28, 2017 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**  Read Data Science Intensive "Getting Started" section on springboard.com.  Set up git repository for DS Intensive course.  Update git and log to restart 100 days of code.

**Thoughts:**  I'm very excited to start up 100 days of code again!  My main focus over the next 100 days will be the Data Science Intensive course which starts on 1/2/2018, but I'm also very interested in learning more about Bitcoin (Mastering Bitcoin book) and Ethereum blockchain development using Solidity.  It will be difficult doing all this while also maintaining a full time job, handling accounting for multiple side clients, and also regular home/friend/family/gf duties, but I'm up for the challenge and I'm starting today.
